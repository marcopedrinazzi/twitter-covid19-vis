# Views Folder

This folder has the purpose to let everyone see our work, since Altair, Plotly and Jupyter have some weird problems that doesn't allow the users to watch the charts on Github.
We have cleaned the two main directories **/generalcovid** and **/fakecovid** and uploaded every chart in .png format. You can find all the .png files in the **views/img** folder.

OGNI FILE DEVE AVERE IL NOME VIEWS_xxxxx</b>
